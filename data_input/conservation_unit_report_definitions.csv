Field Name,Field Description,,
Activity Id,A unique numeric code identifying the SEN,,
Analysis Year,"This is the year that the estimate is for, E.g. 2011. Surveys may have continued into the following calendar year.  ",,
Description,"A concatenated name containing: stream name, species, run-type and year of estimate  ",,
Conservation Unit Name,The assigned name of the Conservation Unit. Note that this name does not identify the species.,,
Conservation Unit Index,"A code assigned to the CU that when prefixed by the species code becomes the CU_index. Originally, these codes were assigned in a roughly S to N geographic order. With each revision to the CUs that order has been lost.",,
Conservation Unit Type,"  There are currently six CU types, i.e.,Current, Bin, VREQ[Bin], VREQ[Current], VREQ[Extirpated] and Extirpated based upon Blair Holtby's Rev 4.0 Conservation Unit data refresh. Definitions for these CU Types are listed below:   CU_TYPE                        DEFINITION  Current                          CU is extant and is either accepted or has been proposed.   Bin                                 Not a CU but a category to hold sites that for some reason are not assigned to a CU. Reasonable uses of the bin category are: a) sites where migratory dropouts are counted that cannot be reliably assigned to CUs; b) sites where transplanted fish are enumerated under the pretense that DFO is recreating an extinct CU; and c) sites where transplanted fish are enumerated that are outside the ecotypical zone of the source fish and where no claim to recreating an extinct CU has been made.    VREQ[Bin]                     VREQ[] : Indicates that there is some doubt about the nature of the CU and valididation is required.   [Bin]-See definition for Bin. The most common use of the prefix is for sockeye CUs on the central and north coasts that were identified by presumed suitability rather than by actual verified records of persistent presence.  The second most common use is for CUs that likely were valid but  it is unknown if they persist. Again these are mostly sockeye CUs.   VREQ[Current]            VREQ[] : Indicates that there is some doubt about the nature of the CU and valididation is required. [Current]-See definition for Current. The most common use of the prefix is for sockeye CUs on the central and north coasts that were identified by presumed suitability rather than by actual verified records of persistent presence.  The second most common use is for CUs that likely were valid but  it is unknown if they persist. Again these are mostly sockeye CUs.   VREQ[Extirpated]       VREQ[] : Indicates that there is some doubt about the nature of the CU and valididation is required. [Extirpated]-See definition for Extirpated. The most common use of the prefix is for sockeye CUs on the central and north coasts that were identified by presumed suitability rather than by actual verified records of persistent presence.  The second most common use is for CUs that likely were valid but  it is unknown if they persist. Again these are mostly sockeye CUs.   Extirpated                  There are no known sites with fish spawning successfully in the wild and there are no known hatchery sites. ",,
Area,This is the subdistrict. In most cases subdistricts are the same as statistical areas. They mainly differ for streams that eventually drain into the Fraser and for large areas that have been split up and thus have a/b/c... designations. E.g. Statistical area 03 has two subdistricts 3A and 3B. ,,
Waterbody Name,This is the name of the waterbody or portion of a waterbody that bounds the population as shown on any given SEN,,

Species_Qualified,"This is an Conservation Unit acronym used to describe the species of salmon for which the escapement estimate is for, eg:  CK - Chinook Salmon CM - Chum Salmon CO - Coho Salmon PKE - Even Year Pink Salmon PKO - Odd Year Pink Salmon SEL - Lake Type Sockeye Salmon SER - River or Ocean Type Sockeye Salmon  ",,
Population,"Default naming originates from previous databases as a concatenation of stream name, subdistrict, species and run type. This is the most important piece of data that all the other SEN data fields refers to.",,
Population Id,A unique numeric code identifying the population,,
Estimate Classification,"This categorizes estimates based on their levels of accuracy and precision. See the Estimate Classification Key for standard definitions. There are three other classifications that belong to SENs whose source data were migrated from the regional MSAccess SILBC16 database (definitions extracted from that user manual). RELATIVE: CONSTANT MULTI-YEAR METHODS and RELATIVE: VARYING MULTI-YEAR METHODS: ""This is the case with survey methods restricted to a fraction of the spawning habitat and/or a fraction of the spawning period. There are various types of relative abundance estimates depending on the survey method, the level of standardization of the methods, and the sampling effort.  For our purpose we have retained one type based on between-year consistency of the method where there are two levels."" NO SURVEY THIS YEAR: ""stream was not inspected for that species this year""  ",,
Estimate Method,"There are several standard methods to chose from. Addition/Subtraction - simple addition or subtraction to provide an estimate. Should be used in conjunction with activity types Adjustment/Calibration and Summary observations. E.g. a population aggregate, the sum of two or more populations, would require the linking of two or more SENs and straight summation of the estimates. Multiplication/Division - simple multiplication or division to summary estimates. This method should be used in conjunction with activity type Adjustment/Calibration. E.g. E.g. An annual estimate that was arrived at by Peak Live Plus Dead analysis can be adjusted by some factor to make it equivalent to a Time Series estimate that uses AUC calculations. Area Under the Curve - Combining a series of point estimates for abundance to create an estimate for the annual abundance. This is done by determining the total area under a curve of abundance by time then dividing by the survey life (the average length of time that an individual is available to be observed alive i.e. is still within the survey area and is not dead). Peak Live Plus Dead - Examine point estimates for abundance, determine the survey when the maximum live count observed; sum the live and dead counts for that survey to create the annual estimate.  Peak Live Plus Cumulative Dead - Examine point estimates for abundance, determine the survey when the maximum live count observed. Sum the live count for that survey with the cumulative total of the dead counts prior to and including that survey to create the annual estimate. Fixed Site Census - Combining one or more raw observations into a single estimate (e.g. add all daily fence observation SIL to create a single annual estimate). Mark and Recapture - Petersen - Use capture and re-capture SIL data to determine an abundance estimate with the Petersen calculation. Mark and Recapture - Jolly-Seber - Use capture and re-capture SIL data to determine an abundance estimate with the Jolly-Seber calculation. Redd Count - Using counts of redds from SILs and multiplied by a factor such as 2. Lake Expansion - expanding the dead recoveries by the recovery effort Cumulative New - N/A ",,
Max Estimate,"This is the maximum estimated number taken from: Natural Adult Spawners, Natural Jack Spawners, Natural Spawners Total,  Adult Broodstock Removals, Jack Broodstock Removals,  Total Broodstock Removals, Other Removals,  Total Return To River, Unspecified Return. ",,
Total Broodstock Removals,This is the sum of adult and jack artificial spawners,,
Total Return To River,"The complete accounting of sexually maturing fish that have returned to the freshwater environment. Total return to river = natural spawners + artificial spawners (e.g. hatchery broodstock) + other removals (harvest, ESSR).",,
Unspecified Return,"Sexually maturing fish that have returned to the freshwater environment. It is unknown whether this estimate refers to adults or adults and jacks, or whether it refers to the total return to river or a portion of. This is the field occupied by nuSEDS V1.0 estimates and some imported data. It is not a category available to estimates created after 2001.",,
No Inspections Used,This is the number of stream inspection logs that are linked to the SEN or were used in the analysis. E.g. 10 stream inspections and a fixed site survey may have been done in the season but only 7 stream inspections and the fence counts will be used to produce the annual estimate(s)  and only these are linked to the SEN. , ,
Other Removals,"Sexually maturing fish that have returned to the artificial / natural spawning grounds and were removed from the natural environment, by humans, prior to spawning for purposes other than collection of gametes. This includes in-river fisheries and surplus hatchery removals (fish that were initially removed for enhancement purposes but were not used for enhancement).",,
Jack Broodstock Removals,These are fish that have matured at an early age and are considered precocious that have been removed from the natural environment for artificially pairing and incubation of progeny in an artificial environment for at least some portion of the incubation period. E.g. hatchery broodstock).     ,,
Adult Broodstock Removals,"All salmon that have reached maturity, excluding jacks (jacks are salmon that have matured at an early age) that have been removed from the natural environment for artificially pairing and incubation of progeny in an artificial environment for at least some portion of the incubation period. E.g. hatchery broodstock).   ",,
Total Natural Spawners,This is the sum of adult and jack natural spawners,,
Natural Jack Spawners,These are fish that have matured at an early age and are considered precocious. They are usually distinguished from adults by their small size. ,,
Natural Adult Spawners,"All salmon that have reached maturity, excluding jacks (jacks are salmon that have matured at an early age). ",,
SEN Presence Jack,"Values are present if jacks were observed, none observed if no jacks were observed during the stream inspections, not inspected if jacks were not looked for, unknown if it is not known whether jacks were observed during inspections or not.",,
SEN Presence Adult,"Values are present if adults were observed, none observed if no adults were observed during the stream inspections, not inspected if adults were not looked for, unknown if it is not known whether adults were observed during inspections or not.",,
Watershed_Cde,45 digit hierarchical provincial code unique to the waterbody and its watershed  ,,
Run Type,"Run Type indicates the run timing for different runs within the same season.  In some cases the runs may be well documented enough to label them as something like ""spring"" vs. ""summer"" or ""early"" vs. ""late"".  But in other cases there is no documentation other than to indicate that there are distinct runs within a season.  In these cases we used the numeric labelling approach for historic data in order to avoid adding unintentional (and potentially inaccurate) detail.",,

Effective Females,Non-standard field which is specific to Fraser River Sockeye. It is the number of females estimated to have successfully spawned. This is calculated by multiplying the total female estimate (less removals eg. for fecundity estimation) by the weighted percent spawn.,,
Weighted Percent Spawn,Non-standard field created to accommodate Fraser Sockeye data. This is based on evaluations of the success of spawn (fully spawned - 100%; partially spawned - 50%; unspawned - 0%) of individual female carcasses. A daily weighted percent spawn is applied to the total female recoveries for that day. The total effective females across the recovery period are summed and divided by the total female recoveries to calculate the overall weighted percent spawn.,,
